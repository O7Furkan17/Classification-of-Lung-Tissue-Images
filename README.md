# Classification-of-Lung-Tissue-Images

This repository provides the code and resources for image processing and classification using the LC25000 dataset, a valuable resource in cancer pathology research. Our focus is on lung tissue classification, leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning models.

Dataset Overview
The LC25000 dataset consists of 25,000 RGB histopathological images, each with dimensions of 768x768 pixels and three color channels. These images are categorized into five histological classes:
•	Colorectal adenocarcinoma
•	Benign colon tissue
•	Lung adenocarcinoma
•	Lung squamous cell carcinoma
•	Benign lung tissue
Each class contains 5,000 images.

Project Focus
In this project, we specifically focus on lung tissue classification, simplifying the task to a three-class problem involving:
1.	Lung adenocarcinoma
2.	Lung squamous cell carcinoma
3.	Benign lung tissue
This classification aims to contribute to accurate diagnostic systems in medical imaging.

Key Features
•	Data Preprocessing: Efficient image loading, resizing, and normalization.
•	Feature Extraction: Advanced techniques to capture discriminative features from histopathological images.
•	Classification Models: Implementation of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to differentiate lung tissue classes.
•	Visualization: Tools for visualizing the results, including confusion matrices and ROC curves.
