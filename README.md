# Classification-of-Lung-Tissue-Images
This repository contains code and resources for image processing and classification using the LC25000 dataset, a significant resource in cancer pathology research.
The dataset comprises 25,000 RGB histopathological images divided into five distinct histological classes:

Colorectal adenocarcinoma
Benign colon tissue
Lung adenocarcinoma
Lung squamous cell carcinoma
Benign lung tissue
Each class includes 5,000 images, each with dimensions of 768x768 pixels and three color channels.

In this project, we focus on classifying lung tissue, treating it as a three-class problem involving:

Lung adenocarcinoma
Lung squamous cell carcinoma
Benign lung tissue

The repository contains implementations of image processing pipelines, feature extraction, and classification methods tailored to this subset of the dataset.
