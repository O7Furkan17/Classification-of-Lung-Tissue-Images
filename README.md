# Classification-of-Lung-Tissue-Images

This repository provides the code and resources for image processing and classification using the LC25000 dataset, a valuable resource in cancer pathology research. Our focus is on lung tissue classification, leveraging advanced image processing techniques and machine learning models.

> Dataset Overview
The LC25000 dataset consists of 25,000 RGB histopathological images, each with dimensions of 768x768 pixels and three color channels. These images are categorized into five histological classes:
•	Colorectal adenocarcinoma
•	Benign colon tissue
•	Lung adenocarcinoma
•	Lung squamous cell carcinoma
•	Benign lung tissue
There are 5,000 images in each class.

> Project Focus
In this project, we specifically focus on lung tissue classification, simplifying the task to a three-class problem involving:
1.	Lung adenocarcinoma
2.	Lung squamous cell carcinoma
3.	Benign lung tissue

> Key Features
•	Data Preprocessing: Efficient image loading, resizing, and normalization.
•	Feature Extraction: Advanced techniques to capture discriminative features from histopathological images.
•	Classification Models: Implementation of machine learning and deep learning algorithms to differentiate lung tissue classes.
•	Visualization: Tools for visualizing the results, including confusion matrices and ROC curves.
